# Flyway Migration Job
# Runs database migrations before application deployment
#
# Usage:
# 1. SQL files are mounted from a ConfigMap (created during deployment)
# 2. Job runs Flyway migrate command
# 3. Deployment waits for Job completion
#
# For ArgoCD, the PreSync hook annotation ensures migrations run before app sync
